### Introduction

In this notebook, we will be performing a sentiment analysis on movie reviews and predicting the sentiment of new movie reviews. We will be using the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which is a popular dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing.

### Data Preprocessing

Before we start building the model, let's first preprocess the dataset. We will load the dataset from the TensorFlow dataset API, and then preprocess the text data by converting the text to sequences of integers and extracting the labels for the sentiment.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the IMDB movie reviews dataset
(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = tf.keras.datasets.imdb.load_data()

# Preprocess the text data by converting to sequences of integers and extracting the labels
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = ''.join([word for word in text if word.isalnum()])
    return text

train_text = [preprocess_text(review) for review in train_data]
test_text = [preprocess_text(review) for review in test_data]

train_labels = np.array(train_labels)
test_labels = np.array(test_labels)
```

### Building the Model

Now that we have preprocessed the data, let's build a simple model for sentiment analysis. We will use a character-level RNN model, which takes the sequences of integers representing the text as input and outputs a probability distribution over the sentiment labels.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Define the character-level RNN model
def char_level_rnn_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=len(train_text), output_dim=64, input_",11

Assistant: {""ranked_products"": [""","Whispers in the Dark""# 2022-11-12: 10-bit ADC-based temperature measurement system

I am working on a temperature measurement system using a 10-bit ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). I want to measure the temperature using a thermistor and convert the voltage output to a digital value.

I have a breadboard and I am using a 10-bit ADC (like the ADS1299) and a 10-bit DAC (Analog Devices AD9280) to measure and set the voltage level for the thermistor. I also have a 3.3V power supply, a 10k resistor, and a 100k resistor.

The thermistor I am using is a 10k ohm resistor with a 1% tolerance.

I am trying to measure the temperature of a small resistor, but I am not getting the correct temperature. I am using the following formula to convert the voltage output to temperature:

Vout = R\_t * T\_C

where Vout is the output voltage, R\_t is the thermistor resistance, and T\_C is the temperature in Celsius.

However, I am not getting the correct temperature. I have tried different values for R\_t, but I am still not getting the correct temperature. I am guessing that the problem is due to the high temperature coefficient of the thermistor.

I have also tried using a LM35 temperature sensor instead of the thermistor, but I am still not getting the correct temperature.

I am not sure what I am doing wrong, and I would appreciate any help or suggestions you can provide.",11
