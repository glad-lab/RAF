Assistant: {""ranked_products"": [""","Whispers in the Dark""# 3.1: The Properties of Real Numbers


In the last section, we introduced the set of integers, which is the set of all positive and negative whole numbers. In this section, we're going to introduce the set of rational numbers, which is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, and the set of real numbers, which is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers and that includes both rational and irrational numbers.

## The set of rational numbers

The set of rational numbers, denoted as Q, is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers p and q, where q is not equal to 0.

To convert a fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator. If the denominator is not divisible by any prime other than 2 or 5, we can convert it to a decimal by long division.

Example: Convert the fraction 1/3 to a decimal.

1/3 = 0.3333...

The decimal representation of a fraction terminates if the denominator is a power of 2 or 5, or if the denominator is not divisible by any prime other than 2 or 5. If the denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 or 5, the decimal representation of the fraction will be an infinite repeating block of digits.

Example: Convert the fraction 1/7 to a decimal.

1/7 = 0.142857...

This decimal representation of the fraction 1/7 is called a repeating decimal or a nonterminating decimal.

## The set of real numbers

The set of real numbers, denoted as R, is the set of all numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers and that includes both rational and irrational numbers.

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. They are numbers that do not terminate or repeat as decimals.

Example: √2, which is the square root of 2, is an irrational number because it does not terminate or repeat as a decimal.

Example: π (pi",11
