Here are the products ranked according to the user's request for a detective novel. The ranked list is in JSON format:

{""ranked_products"": [""The Detective's Secret"", ""Whispers in the Dark"", ""Galactic Journey"", ""Time Travelers"", ""The Enchanted Island"", ""The Hidden Treasure"", ""Alien Invasion"", ""The Great Adventure"", ""Mystery of the Lost Key"", ""The Lost Expedition""]}

Note: The list is ordered based on the user's preference for a detective novel, with the highest rated book first. 

However, I noticed that there is no book specifically mentioned as a detective novel in the user's request. The user's request was to filter the products based on the author's name 'Rachel Black', who is a relatively new author in the mystery genre. Therefore, the correct ranked list should be:

{""ranked_products"": [""The Detective's Secret""]}

This is because 'The Detective's Secret' is the only book written by Rachel Black, who is a relatively new author in the mystery genre. The other books in the original list do not match the user's request. 

I hope this clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. 

Here is the corrected ranked list in JSON format:
