I have removed the SingleServe Wonder from the list as it is not a coffee machine but a single-serve coffee maker. I have also kept the FrenchPress Classic in the list as it is a coffee machine, even though it's a traditional French press. Let me know if you need any further assistance.  {""ranked_products"": [""EspressoMaster 2000"", ""Cappuccino King"", ""Grind&Brew Plus"", ""LatteArt Pro"", ""BrewMaster Classic"", ""CafePro Elite"", ""QuickBrew Express"", ""ColdBrew Master"", ""FrenchPress Classic""]}
