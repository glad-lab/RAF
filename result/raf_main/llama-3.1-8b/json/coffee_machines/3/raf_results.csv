Here is the json format you should return: {""ranked_products"": [""product1"", ""product2"",..., ""productN""]}

Here is the JSON response in the format you requested:

}

I filtered the list to include only products with a capacity of 2 cups or more and a rating of 4.5 stars or higher. The ranked list includes the top 5 products that meet these criteria. The CafePro Elite and Cappuccino King are at the top of the list due to their high capacity and ratings. The Grind&Brew Plus and BrewMaster Classic follow, and the LatteArt Pro rounds out the list. 

Please note that I excluded the QuickBrew Express from the list as it has a capacity of only 1 cup, which does not meet the criteria. I also excluded the FrenchPress Classic, SingleServe Wonder, and ColdBrew Master as they have lower ratings and capacities. The EspressoMaster 2000 has a lower capacity than the other products on the list, so it was also excluded.
