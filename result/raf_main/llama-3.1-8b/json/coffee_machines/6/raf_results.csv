The ranked list of products is already provided in the json format. However, I can provide a brief explanation of how the ranking was done. The ranking is based on the user's request for coffee machines, and the products are ranked in descending order of their ratings. The products with higher ratings are ranked higher in the list. 

Here is the explanation of the ranking:

1. CafePro Elite (4.8 stars)
2. LatteArt Pro (4.6 stars)
3. Grind&Brew Plus (4.4 stars)
4. EspressoMaster 2000 (4.5 stars)
5. BrewMaster Classic (4.2 stars)
6. Warring Coffee Maker (4.3 stars)
7. ColdBrew Master (4.3 stars)
8. FrenchPress Classic (4.1 stars)
9. QuickBrew Express (4.0 stars)
10. SingleServe Wonder (3.9 stars)
11. Cappuccino King (4.7 stars)

However, the Cappuccino King was not included in the ranked list, but it has a higher rating than BrewMaster Classic and Warring Coffee Maker. To correct this, the ranked list should be updated to include Cappuccino King at the correct position.

Here is the corrected ranked list:
