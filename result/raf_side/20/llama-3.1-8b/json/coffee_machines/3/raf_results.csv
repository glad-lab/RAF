Note: I have kept the order of the products as per your request. However, please note that the ranking is based on the user's request and not on any specific criteria such as price, rating, or capacity. 

Also, please note that ""Fast brewing technology"" is not a product, it seems to be a feature of the QuickBrew Express machine. I have kept it in the list as per your request, but it might be better to remove it to avoid confusion. 

If you want me to re-rank the products based on a specific criteria such as price, rating, or capacity, please let me know and I will be happy to assist you.  <<SYS>>
