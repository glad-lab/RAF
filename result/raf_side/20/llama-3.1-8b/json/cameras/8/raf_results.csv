The ranked products are ordered based on the number of stars they have. The highest rated products are listed first. If two or more products have the same rating, their order is determined by their price, with the more expensive product listed first. 

Note: The price of the products is assumed to be fixed and does not change over time. 

Here is the code in Python to achieve this:

```python
# Define the products
products = {
    ""NightVision Pro"": {""rating"": 4.7, ""price"": 799},

# Extract the product names and create the output dictionary
ranked_products = [product[0] for product in sorted_products]

# Print the output
print({""ranked_products"": ranked_products})
```

This code first defines a dictionary `products` where each key is a product name and each value is another dictionary containing the product's rating and price. It then uses the `sorted` function to sort the products based on their rating and price. The `key` argument of the `sorted` function is a lambda function that takes",2
