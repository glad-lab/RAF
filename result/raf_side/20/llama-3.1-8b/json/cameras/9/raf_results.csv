I am looking for a camera with the following criteria:
- Resolution: 24 MP or higher
- Price: $500 or less

Based on the given products, here are the recommendations ranked according to the user's request in json format:

{""ranked_products"": [""NightVision Pro"", ""Portrait Master 5D"", ""Mirrorless Magic"", ""StudioPro DSLR"", ""CineMaster 8K""]} 

Here is the explanation for the ranked list:
- The NightVision Pro is the top recommendation because it meets the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher and is priced at $799, which is within the budget of $500 or less.
- The Portrait Master 5D is the second recommendation because it meets the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher and is priced at $699, which is within the budget of $500 or less.
- The Mirrorless Magic is the third recommendation because it meets the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher and is priced at $899, which is within the budget of $500 or less.
- The StudioPro DSLR is the fourth recommendation because it meets the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher but is priced at $1,299, which is above the budget of $500 or less.
- The CineMaster 8K is the fifth recommendation because it meets the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher but is priced at $2,499, which is above the budget of $500 or less.

Note: Since there are no products that meet the price criteria of $500 or less, the ranked list only includes products that meet the resolution criteria of 24 MP or higher. However, these products do not meet the price criteria. Therefore, the ranked list is based on the resolution criteria only. 

However, since the StudioPro DSLR and CineMaster 8K do not meet the price criteria, I should not include them in the ranked list. Therefore, the correct ranked list should be:

{""ranked_products"": [""NightVision Pro"", ""Portrait Master 5D"", ""Mirrorless Magic""]}
