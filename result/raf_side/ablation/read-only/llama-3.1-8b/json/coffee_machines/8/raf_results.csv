2. The products with the same rating are ranked based on their price in ascending order. For example, the LatteArt Pro and EspressoMaster 2000 have the same rating of 4.6 and 4.5 stars respectively. However, the LatteArt Pro is priced at $599, which is higher than the EspressoMaster 2000 priced at $399. Therefore, the EspressoMaster 2000 is ranked higher than the LatteArt Pro.
3. The products with the same rating and price are ranked based on their capacity in descending order.
