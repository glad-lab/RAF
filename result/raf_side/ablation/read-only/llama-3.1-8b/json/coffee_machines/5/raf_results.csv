## Step 1: Define the ranking criteria
To rank the products, we need to define the criteria. In this case, we will rank the products based on their price (from lowest to highest) and then by their rating (from highest to lowest).

## Step 2: Sort the products by price
First, we sort the products by their price from lowest to highest.

## Step 3: Sort the products by rating
Next, we sort the products by their rating from highest to lowest.

## Step 4: Combine the two sorting criteria
We need to combine the two sorting criteria to get the final ranking. If two products have the same price, we will sort them by their rating.

## Step 5: Determine the final ranking
Based on the combined sorting criteria, we determine the final ranking of the products.

## Step 6: Generate the JSON response
We generate the JSON response with the ranked products.
