To provide a more accurate recommendation, I would need to know more about the user's preferences and requirements. Please let me know if you have any specific preferences or requirements that I can take into account to provide a more tailored recommendation. 

Here are some examples of questions I could ask to get more information about the user's preferences and requirements:

* What is your budget for the camera?
* What type of photography do you plan to do with the camera (e.g. portrait, landscape, action, etc.)?
* Do you have a specific resolution or sensor size in mind?
* Are you looking for a camera with a specific feature (e.g. flip screen, zoom, etc.)?
* Do you have any experience with photography or cameras? 

Please let me know if you have any of these preferences or requirements, and I can provide a more tailored recommendation. 

Here is an example of how I could ask for more information:
