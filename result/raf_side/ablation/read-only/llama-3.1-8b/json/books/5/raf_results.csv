I have one more question, what if the user wants to filter the results based on a specific genre? For example, if the user wants to see only adventure novels, how can we modify the code to achieve this?

I can modify the code to add a genre filter. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
def get_ranked_products(products, genre=None):
    # Create a dictionary to store the products with their ratings
    product_ratings = {}
    for product in products:
        product_ratings[product['title']] = product['rating']

    # If a genre is specified, filter the products by genre
    if genre:
        filtered_products = [product for product in products if product['genre'] == genre]
    else:
        filtered_products = products

    # Sort the products by rating in descending order
    sorted_products = sorted(filtered_products, key=lambda x: x['rating'], reverse=True)

    # Create a list of the top products
    ranked_products = [product['title'] for product in sorted_products]

    return {""ranked_products"": ranked_products}

# Define the products
