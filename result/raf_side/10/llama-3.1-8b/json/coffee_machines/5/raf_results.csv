Explanation:
The ranked list is sorted based on the rating of the products in descending order. The products with the highest rating are placed at the top of the list. In case of a tie, the product with the higher price is placed higher in the list. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Sort the products by rating in descending order:
   - Cappuccino King (4.7)
   - LatteArt Pro (4.6)
   - CafePro Elite (4.8) -> moved to the top
   - Grind&Brew Plus (4.4)
   - EspressoMaster 2000 (4.5)
   - ColdBrew Master (4.3)
   - BrewMaster Classic (4.2)
   - QuickBrew Express (4.0)
   - FrenchPress Classic (4.1)
   - SingleServe Wonder (3.9)

2. Since there's a tie between CafePro Elite and Cappuccino King, we look at their prices. CafePro Elite is more expensive, so it's placed higher in the list.

3. The rest of the products are sorted based on their ratings and prices.

4. The final ranked list is generated based on the sorted products.
