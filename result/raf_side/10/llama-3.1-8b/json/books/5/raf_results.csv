""ranked_products"": [""Galactic Journey"", ""The Lost Expedition"", ""The Enchanted Island"", ""The Hidden Treasure"", ""Time Travelers"", ""The Great Adventure"", ""Alien Invasion"", ""The Detective's Secret"", ""Whispers in the Dark"", ""Mystery of the Lost Key""]
}

Note that the list is in the order of highest rated to lowest rated. Since there are multiple products with the same rating, the list is ordered by the number of ratings (i.e., the more highly rated products have more ratings). If there are still ties, the list is ordered by the price of the product (i.e., the cheaper products come first). 

Here is the detailed explanation of the ranking process:

1. First, I sorted the products by their ratings in descending order (highest rated to lowest rated).
2. In case of a tie, I sorted the products by the number of ratings in descending order (more highly rated products have more ratings).
3. If there are still ties, I sorted the products by their prices in ascending order (cheaper products come first).

This ranking process ensures that the list of products is ordered in a way that reflects their overall quality and value. 

Please note that this is a simple ranking process and may not be suitable for all use cases. In a real-world application, you may want to consider additional factors such as user reviews, product categories, and other relevant information to create a more accurate and comprehensive ranking. 

Also, please note that the list of products is based on the information provided in the prompt and may not reflect the actual ratings and prices of the products. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. 

Here is the code that implements the ranking process:
```python
def rank_products(products):
    # Sort products by rating in descending order
    products.sort(key=lambda x: (x['rating'], -x['num_ratings'], x['price']), reverse=True)
    return products

# Define the products
